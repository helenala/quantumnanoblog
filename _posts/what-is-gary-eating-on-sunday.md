As part of the QN Culture and Community (C&C) committee, Sonakshi asked if I would be willing make some posts just about lighthearted fun stuff on our blog. Since I like cooking a lot, I thought I would make a bit of a silly blog sharing what I’m eating on Sundays! 🙂

With two professors and two young kids (Lara 6 and Thomas 12) in the family, we have a bit of a chaotic life and mostly work on just holding things together. But it’s a lot of fun and as my wife Susan and I are both enthusiastic cooks, we make time to make sure to cook a serious dinner at least twice a week (Saturday and Sunday, enjoying leftovers on Monday and Tuesday…). Our weekend dinners tend to be big, preferably one pot, and flavourful. In this blog, I thought it would be fun to share with QN some of the things we cook with pictures, recipes and tips.

Without further ado, let’s get going with last Sunday’s dinner: “Cottage (shepards) pie with cheesy mash” from the [harry bikers](https://www.hairybikers.com/) “[perfect pies](https://www.hairybikers.com/recipes?book=the-hairy-bikers-perfect-pies)” book.

Due to our renovation at home, I don’t have the book with me, so I can’t post a picture of the page from our book with our custom notes (and lot of splatters) but the original recipe can be found [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/cottagepiewithcheesy_93216).

Cottage / shepards pie is a typical english “pie like casserole” consisting of a mix of ground beef, optionally veg, sauce with a mashed potato topping. This recipe has a nice flavourful sauce and lots of veg. We usually do extra veg (1 kg carrots and a whole “head” of celery). And for Susan, we usually go “irish” on the potatoes (aka just load of extra potatoes, usually increase recipe to 1.4 kg in total). Oh and about the potatoes: tradition may suggest starchy (“kruimig”) potatoes for mash, but I often like this one better with waxy (“vastkokend”) ones. And I usually do loads of extra wine (a third or half a bottle). And you absolutely need proper cheddar: a good strong white preferably a bit crumbly one from England. I usually myself add about 0.5 tsp salt to the sauce and 0.5 tsp salt to the mash (seems that many cooks are too ashamed to specify how much salt they personally use, aside form Ottolenghi, but that is another post…). For herbs, I usual throw in a bunch of “provencial” herbs from a dried mix from the Albert Heijn, and I add about a half teaspoon of dried rosemary (I like it but Thomas is not a fan, so I don’t do too much…)

Here are some pictures from our pie last weekend (Susan made it and I assembled it) along with some tips.

Here is the final result:

The secret of getting the mash potato on is an ice cream scoop with a “scraper” lever followed by careful breaking up and spreading out of the potato balls with two forks:

(You can see the lemon cake Susan made for Thomas’ birthday in the background: also lekker but a different blog post :))
That’s all, I hope you are inspired to try it and if you do I hope you enjoy it!
