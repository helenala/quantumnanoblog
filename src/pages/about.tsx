            <p>The editorial team welcomes you to the official blog of QN!</p>
            <p>
              The department of Quantum Nanoscience is made of people who spend
              an incredible amount of time studying quantum phenomena in a wide
              variety of nanometer-scale devices and materials, exploring new
              physics and novel applications of quantum effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              These individuals from different parts of QN, who work together in
              different fields of physics have varied interests inside and
              outside the department and would like to share their life with
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              To this end, we started a blog of the people and we are very
              excited to introduce to you this endeavor. Thank you for being
              here and we hope you enjoy reading the articles!
            </p>
            <p>Regards,</p>

I work on topological photonic crystals and look at all the cool topological physics happening at the nanoscale using a fancy near-field microscope. Iâ€™m a mother to my beautiful cat, Garlic and if that story isnâ€™t  interesting enough you should talk to me about my love for very (basic) pop music, alcoholic beverages and dead baby jokes. Otherwise, Iâ€™m pretty easy going. Hope you enjoy the blog!"

I work on the nanofabrication and theoretical calculations of two-dimensional materials. Iâ€™m originally from Aruba and moved to the Netherlands to pursue my interest in physics and to see a bit more of the world. I enjoy playing music, in whatever form I can get my hands on."

In January 2022, I joined the Conesa-Boj Lab as a PhD student focussing on machine learning for the theoretical modeling of STEM-EELS measurements of nanostructures. I was born and raised in West-Friesland (but I donâ€™t have a strong accent, I think?). At any moment of the day, you will probably either find me drinking coffee, strolling around on campus or swimming in an indoor pool."

I completed my undergraduate study at McGill in Canada and moved here to Delft for my master and PhD degree. In my PhD research, I study different aspects of electronic and thermoelectric transport in mesoscopic systems, such as single molecules and 2D materials. In my free time, I enjoy cooking and traveling."
